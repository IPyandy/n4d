Introduction

Welcome to Network4Dev! Network4Dev is a community-driven, open source 
networking site. The site was founded by 
`Daniel Dib <http://lostintransit.se/about/>`_ in 2018 and all 
work behind the scenes is done by 
`Cristian Sirbu <https://www.trueneutral.eu/pages/about.html>`_. 
At the time of this writing ``2018-08-19``, the two maintainers of the
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/network4dev/n4d>`_ are 
Cristian and Daniel.

As infrastructure is moving towards more elastic, composable and
automated setups, infrastructure engineers must have a broader
set of skills while still remaining relevant within their speciality.
This means that networking people must understand compute, storage,
applications, systems and coding at a level where they can interact
with the other teams. Conversely, it means that people working
mainly with systems and apps must have some understanding of
networking. While there are plenty of sites and courses for
networking people to learn about automation, there are a lot less
resources for people working with systems and apps to learn about
networking. The goal of N4D is to fill this gap.

In order to write for people that don't have a strict networking
background, the articles will be written to be short, concise and
to the point. The articles will not be deep dives but instead
focus on fundamentals and the **WHY** of networking.

By making this site open source and community driven, more people
can contribute into making this site living and more frequently
updated than a site where only one or a couple of people are
contributing.

In order to contribute to this site, read the :doc:`contributing`
guide.

Please note that all contributions to this site will be reviewed
and edited by the maintainers for quality, accuracy and clarity 
both in terms of language and technical level in order to maintain
our goals.
